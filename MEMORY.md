# MEMORY — resume pointer (layer A; overwrite-only, keep ≤ ~50 lines)

> The bounded layer-A resume pointer (`MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md` §6). OVERWRITE "Current state"

## How to resume

1. Read `README.md`, `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TOOLBOX.md`, `DOCTRINE_ENFORCEMENT.md`.
2. Open the active tree below → its Current Frontier → the next action.
3. Durable facts: `docs/decisions/INDEX.md`. Retrievable lessons: `docs/knowledge/INDEX.md`.

## Current state

- latest_commit: `git log -1`. ⛔ **Do not push** below the 300-commit cadence without the
  director's `scripts/approved_push.sh` act (`decision_push-cadence`) —
  `scripts/check_push_cadence.sh --status` says where we stand.
- **Active trees:** `CITATION-ACCURACY` (1/2 — CITATION-QUOTES registered; `.2` the Markdown census, proposed) · `LIVE-CONTAINMENT` (3/4 — the closed-tree register, the orientation sources, TOOLBOX/DOCTRINE_ENFORCEMENT partitioned; `.4` the doctrine adoption, proposed) · `LAB-BENCH` (1/2 — `.2` feedback-gated) · `ARTIFACT-CLEANUP` (recurring §8; last run `2026-10-06`, `SEMULITH-AC-0059`) · `P5-BOARD` (10/12 — the platform capability manifest landed: `platform.sexp`, derived and drift-gated by the 34th doctrine PLATFORM-GEN; the dossier pin load-bearing; `.5` probes and `.7` gate report stay gated on the CPU's acceptance trajectory) · `P4-SYSTEM` (6/10 — the profile resolved as `rv64gc-lab-v0` (`.1`), the privileged machinery landed (`.2`), and four leaves CLOSED: Sv39 (`.3`), atomics (`.4`), interrupts/counters/wait with the timer wake WITHOUT CPU RETIREMENT (`.5`), instruction visibility with the fence.i contract validated on both engines (`.6`, 6 AGREE of 6)).
  Milestone frontier: `P4-SYSTEM` (the CPU the board waits on). (`BOOK-APPARATUS` and `MCU-DOCS` closed `2026-10-02`, 2/2 each — the MCU documentation set is acquired and digest-verified.)
- next_action: `P4-SYSTEM.7` slice (d3) — `fp.rs`'s format conversions: `f2f(m, n, rm, a)`
  (narrowing through the backend with OF/UF judged on the unbounded value as for every
  rounded op; widening exact; NaN → canonical; sNaN → NV — the qualification record's
  deviation (ii), patched here), `specfp`'s exact conversion, FP-VECTORS extended. Then
  (d4) the staged D corpus, (d5) THE BIND (118 → 150; the evaluator's FToF arm and
  `touches_fp_state` grow there). (d2) landed (`-0050`): `f2f` in the language (gated on
  riscv/d), `d.sem.sexp` (32 rules), the assembler's D spelling derived (32/32).
- in_flight_uncommitted: none.
- blockers: none (0 open upstream issues — `scripts/upstream_exposure.py`; never patch the
  submodule, adopt by moving the pin).
