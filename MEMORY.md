# MEMORY — resume pointer (layer A; overwrite-only, keep ≤ ~50 lines)

> The bounded layer-A resume pointer (`MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md` §6). OVERWRITE "Current state"

## How to resume

1. Read `README.md`, `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `TOOLBOX.md`, `DOCTRINE_ENFORCEMENT.md`.
2. Open the active tree below → its Current Frontier → the next action.
3. Durable facts: `docs/decisions/INDEX.md`. Retrievable lessons: `docs/knowledge/INDEX.md`.

## Current state

- latest_commit: `git log -1`. ⛔ **Do not push** below the 300-commit cadence without the
  director's `scripts/approved_push.sh` act (`decision_push-cadence`) —
  `scripts/check_push_cadence.sh --status` says where we stand.
- **Active trees:** `CITATION-ACCURACY` (1/2 — CITATION-QUOTES registered; `.2` the Markdown census, proposed) · `LIVE-CONTAINMENT` (3/4 — the closed-tree register, the orientation sources, TOOLBOX/DOCTRINE_ENFORCEMENT partitioned; `.4` active: finite archive sealed; full inventory/adoption remains) · `LAB-BENCH` (1/2 — `.2` feedback-gated) · `ARTIFACT-CLEANUP` (recurring §8; last run `2026-10-09`, `SEMULITH-AC-0061`) · `P5-BOARD` (10/12 — the platform capability manifest landed: `platform.sexp`, derived and drift-gated by the 34th doctrine PLATFORM-GEN; the dossier pin load-bearing; `.5` probes and `.7` gate report stay gated on the CPU's acceptance trajectory) · `P4-SYSTEM` (12/18 — `.1`–`.12` closed; CPU-SYSTEM `incomplete`, 8/10 axes open; `.13` contract v2 active).
  Milestone frontier: `P4-SYSTEM` (the CPU the board waits on). (`BOOK-APPARATUS` and `MCU-DOCS` closed `2026-10-02`, 2/2 each — the MCU documentation set is acquired and digest-verified.)
- next_action: `P4-SYSTEM.13` c17d — bind OB-SHAMT with isolated controls for
  all twelve forms after committed count-mask/source-width witness repairs.
  Both bound-shiftw programs now have 60 steps; old 56 positions/values exact.
  SRAW/SRAIW noncanonical-source witnesses discriminate the formerly surviving
  isolated authors/public bad tables only at new boundaries 58/59. Two durable
  width controls first RED, then registered: GUEST-GEN 145, doctrine arms 649.
  Correct core unchanged. Full independent corpus 167/5365/10524; fresh Sail
  60 rows/repeat exact; live base Sail/Spike comparisons pass. Generated data
  and dependent board pins refreshed; 78 bindings/frozen records exact,
  current 76/114 unchanged. The count-mask boundary and SRLW correction remain.
  19 runtime pairs/freeze remain, 47 book chapters. .14 owns statuses/experiments.
- in_flight_uncommitted: none at commit.
- blockers: none. Authorized Kimi closure clears the actual census (`handoff: OK`).
  Sandboxed census is invalid because ps is denied; use the actual unsandboxed check.
  0 open upstream issues (`scripts/upstream_exposure.py`; submodules remain read-only).
