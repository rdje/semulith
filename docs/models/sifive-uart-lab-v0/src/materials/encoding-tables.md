This unit declares its vehicle as `(route device-model)`: there is no encoding space because a device has no instructions — its **register map** is the contract, dossiered as requirement records with the datasheet's locators (`profiles/` … `requirements.sexp`), and its evidence shape is datasheet-derived register-read expectations, not encoded guest programs.
