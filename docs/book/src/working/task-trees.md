# Task-trees

**Nothing changes in this repository without a task-tree leaf that owns the change, created
before the change is made.** It is the binding rule, and `TASK-TREE-OWNERSHIP` enforces it on
every commit.

## What a leaf is

The smallest unit that can be finished, verified, and committed as one signoff-quality slice.
A tree file under `docs/tasks/` carries the goal, the non-goals, the acceptance criteria, the
leaves with their statuses, the current frontier, the decisions, the open questions, the
verification log, and the commit log.

Statuses run `proposed` → `pending` → `active`/`in_progress` → `done`. A stalled leaf is marked
`blocked` with the blocker named, never left `active` — the difference is what a reader six
weeks later needs.

## The acceptance checklist

A leaf that lands a code change carries six boxes, three of them **hard-gated** by
`TASK-ACCEPTANCE`:

| Box | Must contain | Hard-gated |
| --- | --- | --- |
| REPRODUCE / ISSUE | the problem, shown rather than asserted | no |
| **ROOT CAUSE (WHY + WHERE)** | the command run and its real output, naming mechanism and location | **yes** |
| FIX | the change, at the lowest-risk level that works | no |
| **ADDRESSED (verified)** | measured before → after on the symptom | **yes** |
| **NO REGRESSION** | the suite or gate re-run, and its result | **yes** |
| LOCKSTEP | live docs, contracts, and indexes updated in the same commit | no |

The evidence must sit **inside the ticked box's own bullet**. That is not a formatting
preference: scoping it per-box closes two measured leakage paths — a co-staged unrelated leaf
supplying the signature, and a token matched anywhere else in the file.

> **Stated limit.** The gate proves a box was ticked and that tool-shaped output sits in it. It
> cannot prove the output is true. A tick is presence; the un-fakeable leg is re-running the
> cited command.

## The pivot rule

Do not pivot to a different tree while the repository is dirty. Handoff-ready means clean: no
modified or untracked work except the task-tree file itself. Finish the leaf, get clean, then
switch — even when asked to switch immediately.

## Every lane of the plan, and who owns it

Included live from `docs/TASK_TREE.md`, so this map cannot drift from the index the repository
maintains — the OPEN trees:

{{#include ../../../TASK_TREE.md:trees}}

A tree that completes leaves the index and keeps its row, verbatim, in the closed-tree register
(`docs/TASK_TREE_CLOSED.md`, included live too); FRONTIER-SYNC gates both files, so every tree
has exactly one row, by its status:

{{#include ../../../TASK_TREE_CLOSED.md:closed}}

A milestone tree's **acceptance criteria are its gate** — quoted from
`docs/EVIDENCE_AND_GATES.md`, not restated, because a restated gate is a second owner. Its
leaves each cite the roadmap section, task card, rule ID or catalog entry they derive from, so
a reader refutes a leaf by reading one paragraph rather than by trusting the tree.

⚠️ That citation is the strongest control available for a prose-to-structure conversion, and it
is weaker than a test. The honest statement is: the plan is the oracle for these trees, and
nothing mechanically proves a tree still matches it.

## Why this shape

A session can be lost at any moment: a crash, a context reset, a change of tool, a change of
model. The tree is the layer that makes that survivable — its frontier row *is* the next step,
and the acceptance checklist is why a successor can trust the previous step without repeating
it.
