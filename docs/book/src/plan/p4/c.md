# P4.12 — Compressed instructions (C)

**Status:** Underway (slice a, 2026-10-06)

The C extension lets a program use 16-bit instructions alongside the usual 32-bit ones. Linux
software is built to use them. They save space, and each one is simply a shorter spelling of an
ordinary instruction: the specification says every compressed instruction "expands into" a
single standard one. This leaf adds the 37 compressed instructions this profile selects (the
64-bit integer set, plus the four double-precision loads and stores).

Supporting C means teaching the processor model that instructions come in two lengths. It has
to read the first 16 bits, decide how long the instruction is, and only then read more. It also
has to step the program counter by 2 or 4. The plan treats each compressed instruction as data:
the ordinary instruction it expands into, how its operands map, and the specification's own
sentence saying so. The one exception, the compressed jump-and-link, is the one the
specification itself calls out.

Slice (a) brought in the official encoding tables for the 37 instructions, fingerprinted so they
cannot change silently, and generated the model's description of them. Six pairs of compressed
instructions overlap on purpose: for example, the no-operation instruction is a special case of
"add immediate" with every field zero. The upstream tables list these pairs. Each is now
recorded as a deliberate special case that the decoder must try first. The composition checker
still refuses any overlap that has not been declared this way, and any declaration that isn't
genuinely a special case.
