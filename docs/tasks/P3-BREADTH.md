# P3-BREADTH: stabilize only what has been demonstrated

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `P3-BREADTH`
- Status: `proposed`
- Roadmap lane: `ROADMAP.md` §6 → **P3 — Exercise breadth and stabilize only what is demonstrated**
- Gate: `BREADTH`
- Depends on: `P2-SCALAR` (gate `CPU-LAB`), `DSP-REVIEW`
- Unlocks: the **stable cross-architecture API** claim
- Created: `2026-09-13`
- Owner: repo-local workflow

## Goal

Turn `DSP-REVIEW`'s findings into actual interface changes, take a narrow real DSP slice **only
if** its evidence path can be demonstrated, and only then permit the claim that the public
abstraction is stable across architectures.

## Non-Goals

- No claim over unsupported families. A gate that makes an abstraction "general" by leaving
  families unmentioned has claimed them.
- No blocking of architecture-specific CPU progress. `P4-SYSTEM` proceeds in parallel; only the
  *stable general API* claim waits for this gate (`ROADMAP.md` §6).

## Acceptance Criteria — gate `BREADTH`

The stated real subset has evidence; the public abstraction supports the exercised cases;
unsupported families remain unclaimed.

## Task Tree

- ID: `P3-BREADTH.1` — **apply the interface findings**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: implement the abstraction changes `DSP-REVIEW.7` classified as required.
  Acceptance: every change traces to a numbered finding; scalar regression evidence for `rv64i-lab-v0` is preserved and re-run (`EVD-07`).

- ID: `P3-BREADTH.2` — **opaque semantic hooks made explicit**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: where a target needs behaviour the generic layer cannot express, the hook states its contract, its state, and which backends support it.
  Acceptance: no hook is a silent escape hatch; an unsupported construct is a **model-generation failure**, not a guessed translation (`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §2).

- ID: `P3-BREADTH.3` — **real DSP slice: evidence path first**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: demonstrate the evidence path for a candidate real DSP subset **before** implementing it.
  Acceptance: either a working path is demonstrated, or the work proceeds as a deliberately limited **experimental** claim that says so. `SRC-02`: a missing reference route prevents the associated evidence claim, not honest experimental work.

- ID: `P3-BREADTH.4` — **the bounded real subset**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: implement and evidence the narrow slice selected in `.3`.
  Acceptance: its claim names the exact subset; a source-reviewed experimental subset cannot inherit a differentially validated claim from another target (`docs/EVIDENCE_AND_GATES.md` §1).

- ID: `P3-BREADTH.5` — **schema and generator functionality where justified**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: extend the definition schema/generator only where an exercised target demonstrates the need.
  Acceptance: each extension names the target and case that required it.

- ID: `P3-BREADTH.6` — **the `BREADTH` gate report**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: generate from pinned inputs; publish the capability report.
  Acceptance: families with no evidence are listed as **unclaimed**, explicitly.

## Current Frontier

| Order | Leaf | Status | Why next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `P3-BREADTH.1` | `pending` | the findings are the input; implementing before they exist would guess |

## Decisions

- `2026-09-13`: a stable general API **requires** this gate; architecture-specific CPU progress
  does not (`ROADMAP.md` §6).

## Open Questions

- Whether any real DSP oracle becomes available at all. If none does, `.4` ships an explicitly
  experimental claim and the `BREADTH` gate states that limit rather than hiding it.

## Blockers

- `P2-SCALAR` gate `CPU-LAB`; `DSP-REVIEW` findings.
