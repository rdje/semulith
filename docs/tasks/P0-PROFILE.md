# P0-PROFILE: select the first experiment and prove an evidence path exists

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `P0-PROFILE`
- Status: `proposed`
- Roadmap lane: `ROADMAP.md` §6 → **P0 — Select and establish the first experiment**
- Gate: `G0`
- Depends on: nothing
- Unlocks: `P1-LAB`
- Created: `2026-09-13`
- Owner: repo-local workflow

## Goal

Produce `rv64i-lab-v0` as a **development** profile with every foundational choice resolved, and
demonstrate — by running it — that a reference path capable of supplying expected results for
that profile actually works. Deliver the state inventory, the requirements-catalog seed, the
environment contract, three representative guest programs, and the evidence-obligation policy.

## Non-Goals

- No privileged-system support is implied. Selecting RV64I is not a claim that the laboratory
  constitutes a fully specified privileged processor (`ROADMAP.md` §1).
- No instruction semantics are implemented here; prototype support may begin with a small
  declared subset, and the **accepted P2 profile covers its entire declared scope**.
- No RV32 deliverable. Scalar machinery is validated directly at 64 bits (`ROADMAP.md` §1).

## Acceptance Criteria — gate `G0`

1. Foundational semantics are **resolved**: every choice the declared scope needs has an answer
   with a source locator, or is an explicitly recorded open question with an owner.
2. An actual evidence path **works**: at least one matched-profile experiment has been run and
   reproduced, including a failure/event case and not only arithmetic.
3. Profile and reference **differences are enumerated** — not assumed absent.

> Reference acquisition is work with observable outcomes, not an unchecked URL list. Rule
> `SRC-03` forbids recording tool availability that has not been established.

## Task Tree

- ID: `P0-PROFILE.1` — **profile dossier `rv64i-lab-v0`** *(task card `T000`)*
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: RV64I instruction scope, one core, little-endian ordinary memory, explicit entry state, memory boundaries, access and misalignment policy, instruction-fetch rules, environment-trap reporting; the applicable specification revision pinned by exact locator.
  Acceptance: every field has a source locator or a recorded open question with an owner; `SCP-02`'s transitive dependency closure resolved for every included feature.

- ID: `P0-PROFILE.2` — **state inventory**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: registers, widths, aliases, overlaps, reset values, and any hidden or pending state that can influence a future supported observation (`SEM-08`, catalog `C02`).
  Acceptance: each entry source-linked; alias interactions stated, not implied.

- ID: `P0-PROFILE.3` — **requirements catalog seed**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: `requirement.schema.json` records for the declared scope, with `source_semantics` distinguishing defined / implementation-defined / unspecified / reserved, and `research_status` kept separate from `implementation_status`.
  Acceptance: every record validates; every record carries a real `source_refs` locator; no record claims `resolved` research status without one.

- ID: `P0-PROFILE.4` — **environment contract v0** *(task card `T002`)*
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: the versioned assumption/guarantee set from `docs/CPU_ENVIRONMENT.md` §2–§3 — address units, access widths, virtual-time domain, permitted event-delivery points, ordering constraints — each with its authority (`architecture` / `implementation-profile` / `platform` / `laboratory`).
  Acceptance: laboratory policy nowhere overrides an architectural requirement; positive **and negative** fixtures defined for each obligation.

- ID: `P0-PROFILE.5` — **reference candidate dossier** *(task card `T001`, part 1)*
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: for each candidate (Sail RISC-V, Spike, ACT4) record exact source/build availability, supported features, invocation, trace granularity, injection capability, effective configuration, artifact hashes, adapter version, and restrictions on use or shipping (`docs/EVIDENCE_AND_GATES.md` §5, `SRC-01`).
  Acceptance: every field is an observed fact; a candidate that could not be obtained is recorded as such, with the attempt.

- ID: `P0-PROFILE.6` — **matched-profile smoke test** *(task card `T001`, part 2)*
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: run at least one real experiment against the selected reference with a matched configuration — independently encoded arithmetic **and** an access/trap case — and reproduce it.
  Acceptance: actual traces, hashes and configs recorded; mismatches and missing injection capabilities documented. **A reference is not usable until this leaf passes.**

- ID: `P0-PROFILE.7` — **independence inventory**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: per subsystem, whether two comparators share semantic code or expected-result derivation (`EVD-04`). ACT4 computes expected results with a configured Sail model; TestFloat ordinarily derives from SoftFloat.
  Acceptance: known common ancestry **and** unknown ancestry both recorded; neither independence nor correlation assumed.

- ID: `P0-PROFILE.8` — **three representative guest programs**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: small freestanding programs that exercise arithmetic, control flow, and a memory/fault boundary, with independently derived expected observations.
  Acceptance: expected values are derived from the specification, not from any model's output.

- ID: `P0-PROFILE.9` — **evidence-obligation policy and the `G0` report**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: declare, *before* implementation, what kind of evidence each obligation class requires (`EVD-03`); then generate the gate report from pinned inputs.
  Acceptance: the report names inputs, commands, actual results and limitations (`EVD-08`), and reads `passed` or `incomplete` — never `passed` with a missing required check.

## Current Frontier

| Order | Leaf | Status | Why next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `P0-PROFILE.1` | `pending` | everything else is scoped by the profile; `T001` may feed corrections back into it |

## Decisions

- `2026-09-13`: first CPU is a small **RV64I** profile in a specified laboratory execution
  environment (`ROADMAP.md` §1). Revisit only if archogen's named first target makes another
  width or feature set more useful, which is a P0 input.

## Open Questions

- Which reference becomes the primary oracle? Resolved by `.5`/`.6`, not by preference.
- Does archogen's `rt-static-up-v1` profile need machine-mode features this profile excludes?
  `docs/ARCHOGEN_INTEGRATION.md` §6 says a provisional machine-mode profile may be smaller than
  the Linux profile — compare during `.1` when archogen's target decision is available.

## Blockers

- None. This tree is `proposed`; it becomes `active` when its first leaf starts.

## Acceptance Checklist (filled per leaf at execution time)
