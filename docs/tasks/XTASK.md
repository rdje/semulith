# XTASK: cargo xtask becomes the front door, incrementally and with extreme care

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `XTASK`
- Status: `active`
- Roadmap lane: cross-cutting — Rust-native tooling (director, 2026-10-23; `decision_rust-native-tooling.md`)
- Gate: none of its own — every existing doctrine must stay green through every leaf
- Consumed by: the commit workflow — every slice of every tree runs the focused checks and the gate, which
  `XTASK.1`–`XTASK.2` front; consumption point: the first P4-SYSTEM slice after `XTASK.2` (`decision_lane-consumption`)
- Created: `2026-10-23`
- Owner: repo-local workflow

## Goal

`cargo xtask` is the project's automation entry point — check, gate, book, CI, focused checks — reached
through a dependency-free Rust crate, while every existing check keeps its behaviour. Python and shell tooling
moves behind it one shimmed, measured leaf at a time; nothing breaks on the way.

## Non-Goals

- No big-bang rewrite. A leaf ports one thing, keeps the old path as a shim, and proves equality.
- No change to the 35 scripts pinned by the retained M case or to their probes unless a new capture is planned.
- No new crate dependency, no network, no change to the vendored Cargo.lock identity.
- No change to the git hooks until xtask has run green behind them for a reviewed period.

## Acceptance Criteria (every leaf)

1. **Behaviour preserved, measured:** the same exit codes and the same output lines the gate matches, recorded
   before and after on the real tree.
2. **Shim first:** the old script or target stays and delegates (or is delegated to) until every gate arm that
   names it has moved and been fired RED again.
3. **No weakening:** no arm removed, no expected count lowered, no check skipped to make a port pass.
4. **Workspace health:** the wasm build, clippy at deny-warnings, `cargo test`, every doctrine and `make ci` green.
5. One leaf per commit, `COMMIT.md` workflow.

## Task Tree

- ID: `XTASK`
  Status: `active`
  Goal: cargo xtask as the front door, incrementally.
  Children: `XTASK.1` … `XTASK.6`

- ID: `XTASK.1` — **the front door, delegation only**
  Status: `done` (`2026-10-23`, `SEMULITH-XTASK-0001`; owned on clean 79644a8; evidence target/xtask/xt0001;
  prototyped first in a detached worktree, target/xtask-proto, then removed)
  Goal: a std-only `xtask` crate and the `cargo xtask` alias; subcommands `check`, `gate`, `book`, `ci`,
  `vendor`, `hooks` that run exactly what the Makefile targets run; excluded from (or clean under) the
  workspace wasm32 build; registry and toolbox rows.
  Acceptance: each subcommand's exit code and output equal its Makefile target's on the real tree, including a
  RED case (a deliberately broken copy); `make` targets unchanged.
  Result: `xtask/` (std only, no dependency, `[lints] workspace = true`) forwards every argument to `make` from
  the repository root — `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")`'s parent, never `make -C`, whose "Entering directory" lines
  would change the output — with the same streams and exit status (a signal is never success; a missing make is
  127); no argument runs `make help`. So every target keeps one definition, the Makefile, and the subcommand set
  is the Makefile's. `.cargo/config.toml` gains the alias `xtask = "run --quiet --offline --package xtask --"`;
  the workspace gains the member (Cargo.lock +4 lines, no dependency). Measured before landing, in a detached
  worktree sharing the vendored store: fmt, clippy -D warnings, the wasm32 workspace build and API-DOCS green;
  the Makefile's own vendor command for the new lock ran from the local cache with the workspace's three crates
  byte-identical. One effect to know: the lock change makes `make vendor` re-vendor once, which prunes the
  standard library's 31 crates the portability check's Miri leg keeps in the same store (34 → 3); that leg
  re-syncs them with `cargo vendor --sync` on every run, so this is churn, not loss. The API-DOCS ratchet counts
  `xtask/` too (record row `xtask 0`); README (layout, commands, `make book` now names the API reference — a
  RUSTDOC.2 alignment gap closed here), `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §4 (one ownership row; the book includes it) and
  the execution toolbox row follow.

- ID: `XTASK.2` — **the focused-check runner is tracked**
  Status: `done` (`2026-10-23`, `SEMULITH-XTASK-0002`; owned on clean 31f64ba; evidence target/xtask/xt0002)
  Goal: `cargo xtask focused` runs the focused check set the commit workflow uses today (26 checks plus
  `make book`), replacing the scratch runner scripts rebuilt per unit under target/.
  Acceptance: the same 26 results as the scratch runner on the same tree; RED when one check is broken.
  Result: `cargo xtask focused [--out DIR]` is native in the xtask crate (still std only); every other
  argument list still goes to make. The set is the `FOCUSED` table — the 26 commands the scratch runners have
  run since 2026-10-22, in their order — and it is now tracked for the first time. Each check runs from the
  root with stdin closed; its combined output goes to `DIR/<script stem>.log`, one line `HH:MM:SS <command>
  rc=<n>: <last line>` is printed, `focused-checks.json` records `[[command], rc]` per check, and the run
  ends `focused: <n> red of 26`, exit 1 on any red, 2 on bad arguments or an unwritable directory. It never
  commits; the commit stays the `COMMIT.md` workflow's. Three unit tests (every listed script exists and the
  set is 26; log names unique; the clock and verdict helpers). The runner is documented in the README and the
  execution toolbox, not in `COMMIT.md` or the task-tree guide: those are spine files the scaffold updater
  overwrites. From this unit on, the commit chain runs `cargo xtask focused` instead of a scratch copy.

- ID: `XTASK.3` — **one source of truth for the targets**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: the Makefile targets delegate to xtask (or the reverse), never two definitions.

- ID: `XTASK.4` — **the small shell glue, one script per leaf**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: the 14 shell scripts that are neither doctrine drivers nor pinned, each ported behind a shim.

- ID: `XTASK.5` — **check-examples leaves the product CLI**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: the development check `semulith check-examples` (called by RECORD-SCHEMA through `cargo run`) becomes
  `cargo xtask check-examples`; the product CLI keeps product commands only.

- ID: `XTASK.6` — **doctrine drivers, one per leaf**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: unpinned doctrine drivers ported one at a time, output lines kept identical, arms re-fired RED.

## Current Frontier

| Order | Leaf | Status | Why next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `XTASK.3` | `pending` | one source of truth for the targets: the Makefile delegates to xtask, or the reverse |

## Decisions

- `2026-10-23`: the director: "Migration to xtask shall be done with extrem care, and incrementally for not
  breaking anything" (`decision_rust-native-tooling.md`).

## Open Questions

- Whether new tooling must be born in Rust once XTASK.1 exists — proposed in the decision record; to be
  confirmed by the director before any check enforces it. Does not block XTASK.1.

## Blockers

- None.

## Acceptance Checklist (leaf XTASK.1)

[Evidence requirements](../TASK_TREE_README.md#acceptance-checklist-required-for-any-leaf-that-lands-a-code-change).

- [x] **REPRODUCE / ISSUE** — before.log: `cargo xtask help` → `error: no such command: `xtask``; `ls -d xtask` absent; `grep -n "alias" .cargo/config.toml` empty at 79644a8.
- [x] **ROOT CAUSE (WHY + WHERE)** — the project's automation lives only in `Makefile` (15 .PHONY targets) and 288 scripts; `grep -rn "xtask" $(git ls-files)` had no hit; the director's direction (`decision_rust-native-tooling.md`) asks for xtask with extreme care, so the first step must move nothing: delegation.
- [x] **FIX** — `xtask/Cargo.toml`, `xtask/src/main.rs` (`diff -r` against the validated prototype: identical), the workspace member and its comment, the cargo alias, `Cargo.lock` (+4), the ratchet's `xtask` row and directory, README, ARCHITECTURE §4, the toolbox row.
- [x] **ADDRESSED (verified)** — `cmp target/xtask/xt0001/make-help.before target/xtask/xt0001/xtask-help.after` → `help identical to make help`; red.log: `make no-such-target` rc 2 and `cargo xtask no-such-target` rc 2, `unknown-target outputs identical`; SUMMARY.md broken → `make book` rc 2 and `cargo xtask book` rc 2, `broken-book outputs identical apart from timestamps`, restored `4ddfd80e78ce0148abb699ee10c7bd633a659b6472696201524ecd31dcf6ce33` byte-identical, `make book (restored) rc=0`; vendor-and-check.log: `make check rc=0 in 43 s`, `cargo xtask check rc=0 in 24 s`, `check outputs identical as sorted lines (timings and cargo progress lines removed)`, tests `287 passed`, `173 passed`, `17 passed`, 0 failed.
- [x] **NO REGRESSION** — checks.log: `API-DOCS --self-test: 13 pass / 0 fail`, `API-DOCS: ok (5 crate(s) documented; … 267 undocumented public item(s), each crate at its recorded count)`, `PORT-WEB: ok (workspace builds for wasm32-unknown-unknown)`; `make vendor` → `vendor: .app-data/vendor populated from Cargo.lock` (34 → 3 entries; the Miri leg re-syncs the rest); `bash scripts/check_readme_routes.sh` → `README-STABILITY: OK — README.md is 73/85 lines, 4404/4864 bytes`; `bash scripts/check_book_index.sh` → `BOOK-INDEX: ok`; focused checks rc 0 (focused-checks.json); no product crate source changed (`git status --short crates/` empty).
- [x] **LOCKSTEP** — README, ARCHITECTURE §4 (and so the book's architecture chapter), the execution toolbox row, `doctrine/undocumented_items.tsv`, the XTASK tree and docs/TASK_TREE.md, CHANGELOG, MEMORY.

## Acceptance Checklist (leaf XTASK.2)

- [x] **REPRODUCE / ISSUE** — the focused set existed only in untracked runners: `git ls-files | xargs grep -ln "check_memory_architecture.sh.*check_readme_routes"` empty at 31f64ba; target/p4-system-14/a42ax/focused-and-commit.sh, target/rustdoc/rd000[1-3]/focused-and-commit.sh, target/xtask/xt0001/focused-and-commit.sh — one copy per unit; `cargo xtask focused` → make's `No rule to make target` (rc 2).
- [x] **ROOT CAUSE (WHY + WHERE)** — `grep -n "Focused validation passes" docs/TASK_TREE_README.md` = 73: the workflow requires the validation but no tracked file defines the set, so each unit re-derived it from the previous scratch copy (TOOLBOX.md: a diagnostic in a scratch directory is a "trust me").
- [x] **FIX** — `FOCUSED`, `focused()`, `log_name()`, `utc_clock()`, `last_line()` and three tests in `xtask/src/main.rs`; README and toolbox rows.
- [x] **ADDRESSED (verified)** — the same tree, both runners: `scratch rc=0 in 163 s`, `xtask focused rc=0 in 156 s`, both `focused: 0 red of 26`, `26 verdict lines identical (command, rc, last line)`, `JSON records identical`; `1668 self-test arms` → `1667` in LIVE_STATUS: `scratch (broken) rc=1`, `xtask focused (broken) rc=1`, `bash scripts/check_derived_counts.sh rc=1` the single red line, `focused: 1 red of 26`, `broken-tree verdicts identical`, restored `86871d03ddec3b467ea4b8968f91d2213163962bdf2a636b00ce1cea7edd11e1` byte-identical; `cargo xtask focused --bogus` → rc 2 `usage: cargo xtask focused [--out DIR]`.
- [x] **NO REGRESSION** — no-regression.log: `cargo xtask help` vs `make help` → `help identical to make help (XTASK.1 delegation unchanged)`; `PORT-WEB: ok (workspace builds for wasm32-unknown-unknown)`; `make check rc=0 in 33 s` with `287 passed`, `173 passed`, `17 passed`, `3 passed` (xtask), 0 failed; `cargo fmt --all -- --check` rc 0; `API-DOCS: ok (5 crate(s) documented; … 267 undocumented public item(s), each crate at its recorded count)`; `cargo xtask focused` rc 0 before the commit (commit-focused/focused-checks.json).
- [x] **LOCKSTEP** — README (one command row), the execution toolbox row, the XTASK tree and docs/TASK_TREE.md, CHANGELOG, MEMORY.
