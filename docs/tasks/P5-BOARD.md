# P5-BOARD: model one board, and prove it satisfies the accepted CPU contract

## Metadata

- Tree ID: `P5-BOARD`
- Status: `proposed`
- Roadmap lane: `ROADMAP.md` §6 → **P5 — Model one board in Rust**
- Gate: `BOARD`
- Depends on: the CPU release gate (`P4-SYSTEM` → `CPU-SYSTEM`), or a separately accepted smaller profile
- Unlocks: `P6-LINUX`, `AG-OS`
- Created: `2026-09-13`
- Owner: repo-local workflow

## Goal

A minimal virtual platform — memory, reset, timers, interrupt controllers, serial console —
whose devices carry the same dossier, requirement-link and evidence machinery as the CPU, and
which **demonstrably satisfies every assumption** in the accepted CPU/environment contract.

## Non-Goals

- No Linux. Booting is `P6-LINUX`; firmware probes here are device evidence, not a boot claim.
- No device invented to make something work. A device without a source is a device without
  expected results.

## Acceptance Criteria — gate `BOARD`

Devices and composition pass their applicable gates; small firmware probes pass; **no silently
incompatible CPU/environment assumption remains**.

## Task Tree

- ID: `P5-BOARD.1` — **platform specification**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: documented memory map, reset behaviour, timers, interrupt controller, serial console; the canonical board definition composing **exact** processor and device versions (`OWN-05`).
  Acceptance: the board profile pins versions, not names.

- ID: `P5-BOARD.2` — **device dossiers**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: per device — sources, requirements, state, reset, access semantics, side effects, and independently sourced expected results (catalog `C19`).
  Acceptance: devices reuse the CPU's dossier and gate machinery; they are not a lower tier (`docs/EVIDENCE_AND_GATES.md` §8).

- ID: `P5-BOARD.3` — **generated maps and hardware description**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: address maps, wiring and hardware-description data generated from the canonical board definition (`OWN-05`).
  Acceptance: no handwritten duplicate map anywhere; generated artifacts carry their fingerprints and CI detects drift.

- ID: `P5-BOARD.4` — **composition against the CPU contract** — the gate's core obligation
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: for **every** CPU assumption, name the board or device guarantee that satisfies it, or reject the composition. Reset wiring, memory attributes, source priorities, counter units, time progress, access side effects, reservation invalidations, instruction visibility (`docs/CPU_ENVIRONMENT.md` §5, `ENV-02`).
  Acceptance: an unmatched assumption is a **rejection**, not a note. The laboratory's interface tests are re-run against the board provider where meaningful.

- ID: `P5-BOARD.5` — **firmware probes**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: small firmware that finds and interacts with the devices it expects (catalog `C19`).
  Acceptance: a probe failure is classified as a CPU, contract, device or composition issue with an explicit owner — never as an unattributed emulator bug.

- ID: `P5-BOARD.6` — **platform capability manifest**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: the read-only derived export of the accepted processor/device/board profile and its boot contract, for archogen's compatibility checker (`docs/ARCHOGEN_INTEGRATION.md` §3).
  Acceptance: derived, never handwritten; eADL imports facts rather than becoming a second hardware implementation (`OWN-06`).

- ID: `P5-BOARD.7` — **the `BOARD` gate report**
  Status: `pending`
  Goal: generate from pinned inputs.
  Acceptance: a compatible manifest is recorded as **not** proving the OS correct, nor that the manifest matches the implementation.

## Current Frontier

| Order | Leaf | Status | Why next |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `P5-BOARD.1` | `pending` | the composition check needs a specified platform to check |

## Decisions

- `2026-09-13`: a **smaller separately accepted CPU profile** may support an earlier board
  branch for archogen, before the richer Linux profile exists. The CPU-first rule still applies:
  the profile must already have passed a CPU gate (`ROADMAP.md` §P5).

## Open Questions

- Which board? Driven by the first real workload — an archogen OS or the Linux route — and
  decided before `.1`, not during it (`RK12`).

## Blockers

- The CPU release gate.
